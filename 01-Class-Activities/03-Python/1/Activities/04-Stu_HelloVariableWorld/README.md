# Variable World

## Instructions

* Create two variables called `city` and `state` that will hold strings.

* Create two variables called `covid_cases` and `population` that will hold integers.

* Create a variable called `in_quarantine` which will hold a boolean.

* Create a variable called `covid_pct` that will hold the percentage of the city's population with COVID-19.

* Using BOTH traditional string concatenation as well as an `f-string`:
    * Print the `city`, `state`, `population`, `covid_cases`, and `covid_pct` variables.

Sample output should look like this:

```
Chicago, IL has an estimated population of 2716000. There are 12262 COVID-19 cases which represents 0.004514727540500737 of the population.
Chicago, IL has an estimated population of 2716000. There are 12262 COVID-19 cases which represents 0.004514727540500737 of the population.
```

## BONUS

Produce output that looks like this (you will need to do some research on this):

```
Chicago, IL has an estimated population of 2,716,000. There are 12,262 COVID-19 cases which represents 0.45% of the population.
```

## **Hint**

* You will need to use a round() function to return the percentage with two decimal spaces.
