# JOIN Drills

1.  For your first drill, complete the following:
    * Write a query to return the film title along with all of the actors who played in that film.
      * You will need to join three tables to accomplish this.
      * You should figure out the order for which to join the tables, but the tables are `actor`, `film`, and `film_actor`
    * Your query should return the film title (aliased as film_title) along with the concatenated actor name in a column aliased as `actor_name`
    * Sort your result set by `film_title` and `actor_name`.

2.  For your second drill, complete the following:
    * Write a query to return the film category, film title, along with all of the actors who played in that film.
      * You will need to join five tables to accomplish this.
      * You should figure out the order for which to join the tables, but the tables are `actor`, `category` `film`, `film_actor`, and `film_category`
    * Your query should return the film category (aliased as film_category), film title (aliased as film_title) along with the concatenated actor name in a column aliased as `actor_name`
    * Sort your result set by `film_category`,  `film_title` and `actor_name`.
