# JOIN Drills (Part 2)

1.  For your first drill, complete the following:
    * Write a query to return the film(s) that has never been rented.
      * You will need to join three tables to accomplish this.
      * You should figure out the order for which to join the tables, but the tables are `film`, `inventory`, and `rental`
    * Your query should return only the film title for the movie(s) that have never been rented.
    * HINT: There should only be one movie that was never rented.

2.  For your second drill, complete the following:
    * Write a query to return the film categories that have no files associated with them.
      * You will need to join three tables to accomplish this.
      * You should figure out the order for which to join the tables, but the tables are `category`, `film`, and `film_category`
    * HINT: There is a possibly that all categories associated with them, so your result may contain zero records.
      If this is the case, then examine whether or not your query is correct and defend the result.
