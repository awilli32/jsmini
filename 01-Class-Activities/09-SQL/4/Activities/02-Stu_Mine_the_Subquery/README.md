## Mine the Subqueries

In this activity, you will continue to practice subqueries. Work individually or in a group. You can use the [ERD](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/) for help with the queries.

### Instructions

First, create a view that returns all actors for each film. The view should contain the following columns:
* `film_title`
* `actor_full_name` (be sure to concatenate first and last name from the `actor` table)

Create one view using subqueries and create the other view using joins.

Use that view to accomplish the following:

* Identify all actors who appear in the film ALTER VICTORY in the `sakila` database.

#### Discussion
Discuss your preferred method for achieving this result.
