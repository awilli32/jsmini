# Sakila Endpoint Practice

## Instructions

Develop an API endpoint for each of the following:
* An endpoint called `actor` which returns the `first_name`, `last_name`, and `num_of_films` the actor played in
* An endpoint called `film-actor` which returns the `actor_first_name`, `actor_last_name`, `film_category`, `film_name`, `film_rating`, and `film_description` for each movie the actor played in
